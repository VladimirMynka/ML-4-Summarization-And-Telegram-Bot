{"url": "http://127.0.0.1:10037/", "description": "This plugin is responsible for generating a video with a line drawing using the numpy and cv2 libraries. The generated video will have a resolution of 512x512 pixels. The plugin will take two random points - the start and end points of the line. The first frame of the video will have a clean white background, and the last frame will have a fully drawn line. Each subsequent frame will add a small part of the line, gradually completing the drawing. The line should have a thickness of 8 pixels. Additionally, the line should gradually fade out in the old parts, simulating a motion blur effect. To create this fading effect, the plugin can calculate new frames from the previous frames by multiplying the numpy array by a coefficient, resulting in a lighter color. The coefficient will be provided as a parameter in the second paragraph of the user's message. The plugin should save the generated video in the current directory. In the response, the plugin should include the absolute path to the video file in the 'file' field. The plugin should use the methods from the os.path module to obtain the absolute path."}
