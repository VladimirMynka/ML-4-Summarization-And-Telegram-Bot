{"url": "http://127.0.0.1:10028/", "description": "This plugin is responsible for deleting intents. To delete an intent named <name>, the plugin needs to rename the file \"../../../../data/plugins_configs/{name}.json\" to \"../../../../data/archived_plugins/{name}_{timestamp}.json\". To activate this plugin, the user will write \"delete <name>\". The plugin should not be activated immediately. Instead, it should ask the user if they are sure about their decision using the \"usual_communication\" intent. If the user writes \"delete <name>\" again, then the plugin should be activated."}
