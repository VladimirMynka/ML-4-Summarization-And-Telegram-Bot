The plugin will be activated when the user's message has the format `ls <directory_path>` or `cat <file_path>`. The plugin should extract the `directory_path` or `file_path` from the user's message and execute the corresponding command. The output of the command should be returned as a string response. If necessary, the plugin can concatenate multiple lines of the output into a single string."}
