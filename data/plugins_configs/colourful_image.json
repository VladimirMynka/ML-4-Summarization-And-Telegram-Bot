To activate this plugin, the user will send the name of a color, and the bot should respond with an image. The image should be randomly colored but with a predominant color. The plugin should save the image to the current directory and provide the absolute path to the image in the 'image' field of the response. To obtain the absolute path, the plugin should use the methods from the os.path module."}
